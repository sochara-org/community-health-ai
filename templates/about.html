        <h1>About Our NGO</h1>
        <p>(SOCHARA) is an independent non-government organisation registered under Karnataka Societies Registration Act 17A (1960).</p>
        <p>Our mission at SOCHARA is to promote community health awareness through education and outreach programs, conduct innovative research to address pressing public health challenges, and implement action-oriented initiatives that directly benefit community health. We aim to empower communities to take charge of their own health and well-being, advocate for health policies that prioritize community needs and equity, foster collaborations between health professionals, researchers, and community members, and develop sustainable approaches to improve health outcomes in diverse populations. Through these efforts, we strive to create a world where every community has the knowledge, resources, and support to achieve optimal health and well-being.</p>
        <p>Through our AI-powered chatbot, we aim to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide instant access to accurate health information</li>
            <li>Empower individuals with knowledge</li>
            <li>Promote ethical values and moral education in a contemporary context</li>
            <li>Connect users to appropriate health resources</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We believe that the teachings of SOCHARA are as relevant today as they were when they were first written, and we're committed to sharing this valuable knowledge with the world.</p>

        <p>It wouldn't have been possible to achieve this without 40 years of archiving of community health related books and materials at SOCHARA. Special thanks to Ravi Narayan, Mahadevaswamy, John Clarence, Akshay S Dinesh, Vijay Kumar and several others behind the scenes involved in archiving and digitization under the "Digital Archives Project".
